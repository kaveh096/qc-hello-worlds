# QC Hello Worlds

My repo for quantum computing resources and simple practices. My goal is not just to understand what quantum computing (QC) is at a high-level and then move on. I actually want to get some stuff done.

## Resources

As I learn QC, I will list out my resources here for the benefit of others. I will focus only on free resources or material that is likely easily available to most people.

### Prerequisite

Material to review before diving into the other resources.

1. **Linear algebra**: Need to be comfortable with matrix algebra, determinant, trace, eigenvalue, etc. 3blue1brown [has a video series](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra) that I highly recommend.
2. **Python**: There are countless resources to learn python. I'm not going to list them here. Get comfortable with it.

### Quantum Mechanics

The first step is to learn (or re-learn) the fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics.

3. **The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. III**: A classic and insightful introduction to quantum mechanics by Richard Feynman. [Available online for free](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_toc.html).
4. **Susskind's "The Theoretical Minimum"**: A book and lecture series by Leonard Susskind that aims to provide the essential knowledge for modern physics. The [Quantum Mechanics course](https://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/quantum-mechanics/2012/winter) is highly recommended. It's ~20 hours of video lectures. That fact that this is freely available is baffling to me.

### Quantum Computing

Resources that are specifically about teaching quantum computing (QC).

5. **Qiskit Textbook**: An excellent open-source textbook that teaches the concepts of quantum computing from the ground up, with interactive code examples using IBM's Qiskit. [Available online](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html).
6. **"Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" by Nielsen & Chuang**: Often called the "bible" of quantum computing, this is the standard graduate-level textbook. While not fully open-source, it's an indispensable reference.
7. **Quantum Country**: An interactive, mnemonic-based introduction to quantum computing and quantum mechanics. A great starting point for conceptual understanding. [Read it here](https://quantum.country/qcvc).

### Quantum Algorithm Design

Beyond learning a framework like Qiskit, it's important to understand where new algorithms come from. This is like the difference between learning C++ and learning computer science.
